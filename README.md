## Agreements
    Procedures to ensure code functionality
        ensure that any code runs without errors I.E. pressing the run/debug should work and not crash the program
    
    Testing
        unit tests for implemented method / what we determine needs to have a specific unit test

    divide
        divided per class / database implementation
        write unit tests for someone elses classes, each person is given another person who's code they need to write tests for
        if things get difficult class divide may change
        more complex tasks can be done by more people

    ensure robustness
        unit tests
        validation, make sure that the user's inputs are valid. if they arent then let them know
    
    ensure stand alone classes
        by dividing the architectural layers
        make sure each method has a unique function
        testing classes individually

## extra features
    giving item prices (api)
